3. **Ensemble_methods.ipynb**: this Jupyter Notebook combines the predictions by the previous two models.

4. **ULI-track-1-Phlyers.txt**: this is the output of the Track1 model.

5. **ULI-track-3-Phlyers.txt**: this is the output of the Track3 model.

6. **ensemble_1.txt**: this is the first attempt (Ensemble 1) to combine the predictions of the previous two models.
