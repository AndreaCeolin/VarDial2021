This folder contains the following material:

1. **Cross_Validation_SVM_Track1.ipynb**: this Jupyter Notebook contains the Linear SVM model that was trained to distinguish target from non-target languages in the training data.

2. **Cross_Validation_NB_Track1.ipynb**: this Jupyter Notebook contains the Multinominal Naive Bayes model that was trained to classify the target languages.

3. **Track1.ipynb**: this Jupyter Notebook creates a pipeline containing the previous models, and evaluates its performance accuracy.

4. **Cross_Validation_NB_Track3.ipynb**: this Jupyter Notebook contains the Multinomial Naive Bayes model that was trained to classify all the languages in the training dataset.
