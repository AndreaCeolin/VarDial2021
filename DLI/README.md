This folder contains two files:

1. **shallow_models.py**: this Python3 scripts loads the training data for the shared task, ```Dravidianlanid-Vardial2021-train.tsv```, and evaluates a Multinomial Naive Bayes model trained on TFIDF-transformed character ngrams. A Linear SVM can also be selected as the model to train.

2. **cnn.ipynb**: this Jupyter Notebook contains the CNN model trained for the task, along with its evaluation.
